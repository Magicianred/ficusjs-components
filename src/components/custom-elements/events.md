# Events

Events are sent to notify code of interesting things that have taken place.
Each event is represented by an object which is based on the [Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) interface,
and may have additional custom fields and/or functions used to get additional information about what happened.
