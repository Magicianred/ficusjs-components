# Welcome

Ficus components is a library of styled custom elements and HTML elements.

The goals of the library include providing custom elements only when required, utilising HTML and CSS as much as possible, ensuring components are lightweight, ensuring design and development best practices, improving UI consistency and quality, and aligning with browser standards.

The library is built using HTML, Sass and modern Javascript. If you're using a framework, you can use all components by following our guidelines.
